Kickstarter Challenge

##Overview of Project

This project is to help Louise in her crowdfunding campaign with her budget of 10,000$, excel will to used organize, sort and analyze data to get useful insights for the success of her campaign. 

###Purpose

The purpose of the analysis is to make Louise understand the campaign process and the factors that influence her crowdfunding success.

##Analysis and Challenges

###Analysis

Analysis was done on a data set of 4113 crowdfunding campaigns. Pivot tables and line graphs were used to analyze the theater Kickstarter campaign outcomes based on launch date. On the other hand, the goals of campaign were analyzed in ranges to find the percentage of the successful, failed and canceled outcomes.  

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

The analysis shows that theater plays has more successful outcomes than failed. The results also shows that some months had higher successful rates than others. The results showed better months with higher successful rates.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

The goals were sorted in ranges and the number of the successful, failed and canceled percentage was found for each range and then results plotted on a line graph. The results shows that theater plays with small budget has a higher success number and plays with large budgets has high failed number.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

The first challenge was encountered is changing the launch date and deadline in data set from Unix format to data format. The second challenge was to use the text to columns with the “/” to split Parent Category and Subcategory. The last challenge was filtering the months in the pivot table to shows the months with highest successful/failed outcomes.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

The line graph shows that the highest number of theater successful campaigns took place in May with 111 successful campaigns followed by the months of June with 100 and July with 87. The Months of December had the lowest number with 2 campaigns. 

 
Line graph: Theater Outcomes Based on Launch Date


- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

The line graph of the Outcomes based on Goal shows that projects with goals up to range of 15000 to 19000 has the highest successful percentage with more than 50% and the line graph also shows that both ranges 35000 to 39999 and 40000 to 44999 has a 66% success rate. While the range from 45000 to 49999 has a 0% success rate.

 
Line graph: Outcomes Based on Goal

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

The limitation is that there is not enough data on campaigns with higher than 25000 goal where the number of campaigns was almost lower than 10 campaigns.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

It might be more representative to use bar graph for the ranges of the goals. The pivot tables can also be used to analyze outcomes based on the country.
